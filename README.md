That's my app that encrypt and then decrypt text you enter using Ceasar Code.
It works by shifting signs of your message, every sign by random number of signs from signs base.
Decode of that message work as reversal of that process.

It's all made using React, TypeScript and SASS.
You can try it on this demo: https://cesar-cypher.web.app/

I invite you to check my code and enjoy!
